# TriMet QuickStop

### By **Phil Mass**

## Description

_This JavaScript application is built with React and show's commuters the arriving MAX trains, buses, and streetcars at their regular morning and evening stops with no clicks. It chooses which stop to display based on the time of day._

_The spiritual progenitor of this project was an [Angular application](https://github.com/philrmass/trimet-commuter.git) that I wrote with three other students at Epicodus during our 4 day group project. I decided to rewite it in Go and React in order to give it a real back-end and improve its basic functioning since I use it every day. The other three students who wrote the earlier project with me are [Scott Bergler](https://github.com/skillitzimberg), [Ralph Perdomo](https://github.com/pseudoralph), and [Jared Reando](https://github.com/JaredReando)._
