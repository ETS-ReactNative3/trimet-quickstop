## Component Tree

## Application Sketches

I created these sketches of the various dynamic states of the app in order to sort out the component hierarchy

#### Normal Mode (morning/evening stop set)

#### Setup Mode (morning/evening stop not set)

#### QuickStop Mode (quick stop set)

#### Map Overlay (map showing vehicle/stop location)

#### Set Stop Overlay (stop selection by location/address/line)

#### Login Overlay (menu when logged out)

#### Logout Overlay (menu when logged in)

#### Register Overlay (menu when registering)
